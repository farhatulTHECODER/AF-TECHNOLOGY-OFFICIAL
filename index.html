    WHITE HAT HACKERS
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font color="white">
White hat hackers fit into two categories: penetration testers and red teams. Some security researchers consider themselves to be white hat as well. These are the proverbial good guys, the ones who profess to do no harm and follow all the rules. They are employed by companies or hired out as contractors to test enterprises. The ethical hacker job market is extremely vibrant and continues to expand as the concern over cybersecurity continues to grow.

BLACK HAT HACKERS
</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="white">
Black hats are hackers who have malicious intent or who profit from their hacks. These are the ones that hack for fun, for profit, or with the intent purpose of causing damage. There are many different types of Black Hat hackers but they fall into categories based on their goals: State-sponsored hackers and criminals. These are two general groups but they can be broken down further. The term Black Hat is the official term for bad hackers in every security textbook and certification so it is important to know. However, there are hackers who do good who consider themselves black hat, and one of the biggest hacker conferences is called Black Hat. I personally prefer to simply refer to hackers that commit crimes as “criminals” when not studying for a cert.
